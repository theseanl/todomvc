This repository contains every TodoMVC app made with Typescript in the original [tastejs/todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc), and minimal tweaks made on top of it to compile the minimally-modified sources with [TSCC](https://github.com/theseanl/tscc). It mostly consists of adding a `tscc.spec.json` file describing the entry file and what external NPM library you are going to use. More detailed description of changes made are available in each project's readme.
